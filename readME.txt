Not Present: Erick

Main idea for this meeting is to decide what framework we would like to work with.
- Frame work fastAPI/ python since this would allow for us to work in a well structured enviorment that is optomized.
- Some tasks for people to work on before next meeting are: create a main file and start creating the basic framework for this
Assignment and structure of the code, locate a server hosting service (github student access) and try and get it connected
before next meeting.
- If we are using Zenhub soneone try and get our objectives written down so we can start using that to manage tasks.
- The breaking up of tasks will be layed out in discord.
